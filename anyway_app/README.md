## Project Architecture

As in all Flutter projects, all app files are under /lib, app entry point is main.dart
Following the clean architecture paradigm the app is divided into:
- Business Logic - models, utils, view models - each screen should have it's own view model (MVVM style). Keep it clean (should theoretically be able to share between platforms). 
Uses [provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) state management 
- Services - storage (not yet implemented) and web API implementation. Uses a service provider via [get_it](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it) package. Comments service (not yet implemented) to manage all comments related logic.
- UI - all Flutter related pages, widgets and styles
